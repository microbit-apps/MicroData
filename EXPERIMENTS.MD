Cardboard, string, bubblewrap and plastic bags.<br>

# Experiment:
1. Students are split into groups and tasked with using their materials to protect the microbit the best they can.
2. The teacher can use the commander mode to setup the microbits the students are using to record accerelometer data and stream it back to the teacher.

## MicroData setup:
1. Commander to control the Microbit that will be dropped:<br>
![Select Commander mode](resources/selecting_commander_mode.png.png)
2. Select 'Start Logging'

3. Select the X, Y, Z accelerometers:<br>

4. Configure the accelerometers to read only when the reading is above 50 using events:<br>
    4.1. Press A on the first sensor:<br>
      ![selecting_logging_settings_sensors](resources/selecting_logging_settings_sensors.png)
      
    4.2. Press A on measurements and then use Up and Down. Press A when you are done to confirm:<br>
      ![selecting_measurement_qty](resources/selecting_measurement_qty.png)
      
    4.3. Move Down to the Period/Event toggle:<br>
      ![selecting_period_vs_event](resources/selecting_period_vs_event.png)
      
    4.4. Press Left & Right to toggle between modes (Green is active, White is inactive). Then press A to continue:<br>
      ![selecting_period_vs_event_2](resources/selecting_period_vs_event_2.png)
      
    4.5. Use the Up and Down to change the inequality sign to a >:<br>

4. All the students can make lots of noise for 10 seconds.

5. The teacher can see which microbit recorded the least noise; pronouncing the winning group.


# Biology Experiment:
How does the amount of water and the frequency of watering a plant affect its growth?

## Requirements:
Each student or group of students needs a Microbit + Arcade Shield & a soil moisture sensor.<br>
Student(s) have a unique water plan to follow - for example watering each plant every other day - or giving each plant a small amount of water every day.

## Experiment:​
1. Each day the student(s) measure the height of their plant.
2. Each day they will follow their water plan. 
3. At the end of the experiment the student(s) can make a table in their notebook(s) from the readings saved on the micro:bit and the corresponding height of the plant.​
4. The student(s) can then share their results with the rest of the class to create a full table of data and analyse how a plant's height is affected by how it is watered.​


# Making-an-ammeter
How can we turn a voltmeter into an ammeter? Can we use it to explore the relationship between voltage, current & resistance?

## Requirements:
1. A microbit + an Arcade Shield.
2. Wires/crocodile clips.
3. Some resistors.
4. Circuits to measure & make.

# Background:
The bbc micro:bit has 3 pins with which to measure voltage, in addition to a 3V supply and a ground pin. We can use the live data viewer to see the voltage of a circuit in realtime. We cannot directly measure the current of a circuit using a voltmeter, for that we need an ammeter; which we can make using a voltmeter and a resistor.

The equation below tells us the relationship between voltage, current & resistance:<br>
Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)

If we know two of these variables then we can rearrange this equation to calculate the third one. For example, our voltmeter allows us to read the voltage at a point in a circuit, if we also know the resistance at that point then we can calculate the current:<br>
Current (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R)

We can use this fact to create an ammeter by using a shunt resistor (a resistor with a known value). We can measure the voltage across this resistor and then plug the numbers into the equation above to calculate the current.
